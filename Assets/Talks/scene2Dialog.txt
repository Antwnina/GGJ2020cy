2.1: Well, hello there. I have a question for you. Do you know what's my name?

2.2.: You, who know all, do you know who got me drunk last night? And do you have a pair of underpants my size?

2.3: What is this? Are you drunk?

2.4: I'm never drunk, you ignorant.

2.5: To be honest, I could use a beer. Do you have any?

2.6: I don't have time for this. Tell me what you want, you stupid.

2.7: The Bartender sent me here. Speak or I will chop everything down!

2.8: I was told you can help me, but fine - be a bitch!

2.9: Watch your mouth, little lady! Want my help or not?

2.10: I'm a little upset. I apologize. Please help me. Don't abandon me!

2.11: Alright. The truth is, I know everything. And I know for a fact that you had a LOT to drink last night. But this ugly bitch you were with, I've never seen her again.

2.12: But I must find her. Maybe she knows where's my nose - and my underpants!

2.13: Oh, lords of heaven! I am so angry I could cut the whole village down! Tell me what to do or you will be the first!

2.14: Stop all this nonsense! Go the old man in the cave. Maybe he can help.

2.15: But remember! He's old and poor. You should buy him a gift. I think he would enjoy these very expensive slippers.

2.16: Oh, what has happened to the world? I have no nose, no memories and no underpants! Where will I find the money?

2.17: That is not my problem, annoying noseless peasant! Be gone.

2.18: Oh, look! Behind you! There's a magnificent beautiful parrot!

2.19: Oh, but you are such a kind soul! Let me have them and I promise, I will back to work for you!
