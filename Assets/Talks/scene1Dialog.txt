1.1: Hello, fair bartender. I am in great need, so my dead parrot sent me here.

1.2: You really had too much to drink last night...

1.3: Good evening. I really need a beer.

1.4: Don't you think you had enough beer last night?

1.5: I don't even know who I am. What happened last night?

1.6: Beer is never enough! But do tell, what happened last night?

1.7: All I know is an ugly old woman dressed in black paid for your drinks. Perhaps, she's the one to blaim!

1.8: Go to the General Store at once, the know-it-all there may have your answer.

1.9: This sounds good. I'll go there right now!

1.10: You might be right. I must leave. But first, pour me a beer! I need the strenght to continue!
